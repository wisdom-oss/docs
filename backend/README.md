# Backend Overview
The Backend consists of three major parts:
 * [Kong API Gateway](kong.md) 
   ([ext. Website](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/))
 * [Authentik](authentik.md) 
   ([ext. Website](https://goauthentik.io/docs/))
 * [Microservices](microservices.md)

All three parts and their dependencies are running in Docker Containers managed
by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) using a 
[docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/wisdom-oss/deployment/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
file.
> ðŸš¨ The linked `docker-compose.yml` file is currently under rework. The content
> of this file may change or be temporarily unavailable.

## Kong API Gateway

<a href="https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/">![Documentation Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/External%20Docs-docs.konghq.com%2Fgateway%2Flatest%2F-informational?style=for-the-badge)</a>

The Kong API Gateway is responsible for routing incoming requests to the
microservices after validating the authorization contained in the request at
the authentik service.
