# Backend Overview
The Backend consists of three major parts:
 * [Kong API Gateway](kong.md) 
   ([ext. Website](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/))
 * [Authentik](authentik.md) 
   ([ext. Website](https://goauthentik.io/docs/))
 * [Microservices](microservices.md)

All three parts and their dependencies are running in Docker Containers managed
by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) using a 
[docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/wisdom-oss/deployment/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
file.
> ðŸš¨ The linked `docker-compose.yml` file is currently under rework. The content
> of this file may change or be temporarily unavailable.

## Kong API Gateway
![Docker Image Version (tag latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/_/kong/alpine?style=for-the-badge&label=Current%20Version%20(On%20Docker%20Hub))
<a href="https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/">![Documentation Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/External%20Docs-docs.konghq.com%2Fgateway%2Flatest%2F-informational?style=for-the-badge)</a>

The Kong API Gateway is responsible for routing incoming requests to the
microservices after validating the authorization contained in the request at
the authentik service.

## Authentik
<a href="https://goauthentik.io/docs/">![Documentation Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/External%20Docs-goauthentik.io%2Fdocs-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=fd4b2d)</a>

Authentik is responsible for managing the authorization for this project.
It allows authentification and authorization via multiple providers like
* LDAP
* OAuth 2.0 (including Open ID Connect) (âœ… used in this project)
* SAML

and even allows protecting applications that cannot use those providers via
proxy authentification.

It also allows the usage of external authentification sources like:
* Azure AD
* GitHub.com or a GitHub-Enterprise server
* LDAP
* OpenID Connect
* SAML
