# Backend Overview
The backend of the WISdoM project is designed as microservice architecture
containing the following major core parts:
* [authentik](https://goauthentik.io)
* [Kong API Gateway](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/)
* [Postres](https://www.postgresql.org/) with the 
  [PostGIS extentsion](https://postgis.net/)
* [Service Detection](https://github.com/wisdom-oss/gateway-service-watcher)

These three parts manage the routing and authentification for the microservices
behind the API gateway.

## Architecture
As already mentioned, the backend is constructed as microservice archtecture
allowing the creation of multiple instances of one service if a large number
of requests are exprected for this single service.

## Deployment
To allow a unified deployment of the core project (the frontend, and the listed
core parts) the project uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com) together with 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) as deployment mechanism.

## Microservices
Since the selected architecture is a microservice architecture, the creation of
a new microservice is pretty straightforward. Just use the 
[template](https://github.com/wisdom-oss/microservice-template) for writing
a service in [Golang](https://go.dev).

## Notes
### Emojis
Throughout the backend documentation, emojis are used to mark important steps
and notes.
If an emoji appears at the top of a page, the emoji is valid for the whole page
and the actions/commands listed on it!
To make the usage unified, here are some predefined emojis with their
meanings:

<table align="center">
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Emoji</td>
