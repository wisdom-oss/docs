# Setting a administrator password

If Authentik is started the fist time you will need to access the authentik
installation on the following path:
`https://<your-authentik-binding>/if/flow/initial-setup/`
and set a password for the administrative user `akadmin`.

:::danger

Until the password for the administrative account is not set the administrative
UI will not be reachable
